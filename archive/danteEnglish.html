<p>
Midway along the wild path of life,<br>
I stumbled through the darkness of a wood,<br>
in which the straight track had been lost from sight.
</p>


<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita<br>
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,<br>
ché la diritta via era smarrita.
</p>
<p class="code">
In-the middle of-the path of our life<br>
me I-found for a forest dark,<br>
of-which the straight way was lost.
</p>
</span>

<p>
How hard it is to say what that thing was,<br>
this forest, savage and fierce that drowns with power,<br>
that just to think of it renews my fear.
</p>

<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura<br>
esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte<br>
che nel pensier rinova la paura!
</p>
<p class="code">
Ay how to say what it-was is thing hard<br>
this forest savage and harsh and strong<br>
that in-the thought renews the fear!
</p>
</span>

<p>
It is so harsh that death is not much worse,<br>
but to portray the good that I found there,<br>
I will recount of other things I saw.
</p>

<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
Tant’è amara che poco è più morte;<br>
ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai,<br>
dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte.
</p>
<p class="code">
So-much it-is bitter that little is more death;<br>
but to portray of-the good that I there found,<br>
I-will-tell of the other things that I there have seen.
</p>
</span>

<p>
I can't explain how I had ended there,<br>
so tired had I fallen by that point,<br>
that I abandoned every careful way.
</p>

<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
Io non so ben ridir com’i’ v’intrai,<br>
tant’ero pien di sonno a quel punto<br>
che la verace via abbandonai.
</p>
<p class="code">
I not know well to-recount how I there entered,<br>
so-much I-was full of sleep at that point<br>
that the true way I-abandoned.
</p>
</span>

<p>
But when I reached the foot of that kind hill<br>
at which that freezing valley came to rise<br>
that pierced my heart with fear until that point,<br>
I looked above and saw its shoulders clothed<br>
already with the warmest rays of sun,<br>
the light that leads us all on every path.
</p>

<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
Ma poi ch’i’ fui al piè d’un colle giunto,<br>
là dove terminava quella valle<br>
che m’avea di paura il cor compunto,<br>
guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle<br>
vestite già de’ raggi del pianeta<br>
che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle.
</p>
<p class="code">
But then when I was to-the foot of a hill reached,<br>
there where ended that valley<br>
that to-me had of fear the heart pierced,<br>
I-looked to high and saw the its shoulders<br>
clothed already with-the rays of-the planet<br>
that leads straight others through every path.</p>
</p>
</span>

<p>
Then was the fear a little quieted,<br>
which'd lasted like a black lake on my heart<br>
that night which I'd just passed with so much sorrow.
</p>

<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
Allor fu la paura un poco queta,<br>
che nel lago del cor m’era durata<br>
la notte ch’i’ passai con tanta pieta.
</p>
<p class="code">Then was the fear a little quieted,<br>
that in-the lake of-the heart to-me had lasted<br>
the night that I passed with so-much sorrow.
</p>
</span>

<p>
And like one soaked and gasping out of breath<br>
whose come out of the ocean to the shore<br>
turns and looks upon the crashing waves,<br>
so the spirit mine that still was fleeing,<br>
turned behind to gaze along the path<br>
that never yet left anyone alive.
</p>

<span class="disappearing">
<p class="serif">
E come quei che con lena affannata,<br>
uscito fuor del pelago a la riva,<br>
si volge a l’acqua perigliosa e guata,<br>
così l’animo mio, ch’ancor fuggiva,<br>
si volse a retro a rimirar lo passo<br>
che non lasciò già mai persona viva.
</p>
<p class="code">And like one who with breath labored,<br>
having come out of-the sea to-the shore,<br>
turns to-the water perilous and looks,<br>
just-so the spirit mine, that still was-fleeing,<br>
itself it-turned to behind to gaze the path<br>
that never left yet any person alive.
