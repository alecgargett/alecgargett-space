  Scholars believe:
  </p>
  <h4>More than 13 billion years ago (bya)</h4><p>
  Estimated beginning of the Big Bang. Within a second neutrons, protons (hydrogen nuclei) and electrons formed. Within a few minutes, helium nuclei formed. But it took about 400,000 years for the temperature to drop low enough for electrons to begin to orbit these nuclei and create atoms, which coincided with the creation of the first photons, the first light.</p>
  <h4>~13.6-15.3 bya</h4><p>   
  About 200 million years later, the first stars had formed,<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/765/1/L12" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> probably including the Methuselah star in our own galaxy, the oldest star our scientists have measured, just 190 light-years away.</p>
  <h4>~13.4-15.1 bya</h4><p>
  Another 200 million years or so later, the first galaxies had formed, including our own galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>
  <h4>More than 12 bya</h4><p>
  Within one billion years of the formation of atoms, the first planets formed.</p>
  <h4>~10 bya</h4><p>
  Andromeda probably formed around this time, the closest galaxy to our own.</p>
  <h4>~4.6 bya</h4><p>
  The Sun formed, surrounded by a disc of solid materials, starting as dust, later coalescing to become asteroids and planets.</p>
  <h4>~4.5 bya</h4><p>
  Around 100 million years later, the Earth and the Moon had formed, likely from a collision between two early planets. Immediately following the collision Earth was still molten lava even at the surface, over 1000 degrees, and too hot to sustain life.</p>
  <h4>~4.3-4.1 bya</h4><p>
  The Earth cooled to an average temperature at sea level of 100 degrees Celsius, cool enough for liquid water on the surface, eventually covering the planet in one large ocean. The first self-replicating organisms appeared, possibly RNA-based proto-cells similar to virus cells.</p>
  <h4>~4.0-3.8 bya</h4><p>
  The first self-replicating DNA-based organisms evolved, also single-celled, like bacteria.</p>
  <h4>~3.5 bya</h4><p>
  Cyanobacteria started to create oxygen.</p>
  <h4>~2.9 bya</h4><p>
  For the first time, the average temperature dropped to the same temperature as today and the first ice age began. Ice covered the south pole for the first time and temperatures dropped even lower.</p>
  <h4>~2.5-2.2 bya</h4><p>
  First oxygen-using organisms evolved.</p>
  <h4>~2.4 bya</h4><p>
  The abundance of oxygen broke down methane leading to the Huronian Glaciation, one of the coldest periods in Earth's history, and water was frozen across the whole planet.</p>
  <h4>~1.8 bya</h4><p>
  Through the shifting of tectonic plates below the surface of the ocean, the largest continent yet begins to form.</p>
  <h4>~520 mya</h4><p>
  After more than two billion years of evolution, the first fish evolved. They were the first vertebrates, meaning the first animals to have spines.</p>
  <h4>~470 million years ago (mya)</h4><p>
  The first land plants evolved from algae.</p>
  <h4>~500 mya</h4><p>
  Average temperature reaches about 30 degrees, the hottest in billions of years.</p>
  <h4>~400 mya</h4><p>
  First plants with roots and first insects.</p>
  <h4>~375-350 mya</h4><p>
  The first amphibians evolved, though not yet members of the clade "Amphibia".</p>
  <h4>~350-330 mya</h4><p>
  The first reptiles evolved.</p>
  <h4>~350-170 mya</h4><p>
  The first amniotes, dinosaurs and mammals evolved.</p>
  <h4>~310 mya</h4><p>
  The supercontinent Pangea forms, the largest continent yet. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1OreyX0-fw&t=49s" target="_blank">"History of the Earth" video</a>)</p>
  <h4>~300 mya</h4><p>
  Another ice age occurs. Average temperature drops briefly to about 12 degrees.</p>
  <h4>~300 mya</h4><p>
  Average temperature spikes to 35 degrees, again the hottest in billions of years.</p>
  <h4>~150 mya</h4><p>
  The first birds evolved.</p>
  <h4>~150 mya</h4><p>
  The first flowers evolved.</p>
  <h4>~110 mya</h4><p>
  The continent that is now Africa split from the continent that is now South America. They drift apart due to the splitting of the tectonic plates beneath them. The land mass that is now India and Madagascar split from the landmass of Antarctica and Australia and starts drifting towards what will become Asia.</p>
  <h4>~90 mya</h4><p>
  The first bees evolved. Argentinosaurus also, perhaps the largest land animal ever, also existed around this time. The continent that is now Australia split from the continent that is Antarctica. The landmass of India split from Madagascar and continues North.</p>
  <h4>~90-66 mya</h4><p>
  The first primates had evolved by this time.</p>
  <h4>~77-32 mya</h4><p>
  UY Scuti, now the largest star observed by volume, may have formed around this time. It is about 5 billion times larger than our Sun by volume but much less dense than our Sun with about 30 times more mass.</p>
  <h4>~66 mya</h4><p>
  The Chicxulub asteroid struck the water just off the coast of what is now Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico. All dinosaurs except for birds become extinct. This is the same Peninsula that would later be the home of the Mayan civilisation.</p>
  <h4>~50 mya</h4><p>
  Global temperatures reach a peak of 27 degrees before beginning a steady decline.</p>
  <h4>~50 mya</h4><p>
  India collided with Asia and formed the Himalayas. Europe, North America and other continents were now quite a similar shape to their current forms.</p>
  <h4>~35-20 mya</h4><p>
  The first apes had evolved.</p>
  <h4>~10 mya</h4><p>
  North America and South America conjoined.</p>
  <h4>~10-5 mya</h4><p>
  The ancestors of humans in Africa began to evolve separately from the ancestors of chimpanzees and bonobos. Initially some species may have had as few as 10-20 individuals in the species. Other species may have had as many as 500 individuals. Archaeologists have found fossils that have been dated to this period in Africa, Bulgaria and Greece. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZv8VyIQ7YU" target="_blank">"Seven Million Years of Human Evolution" video</a>)(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils" target="_blank">List of human evolution fossils</a>)</p>
  <h4>~4 mya</h4><p>
  Our ancestors the Australopithecus had evolved feet that are exclusively for walking and running and could no longer grasp branches or other objects with their feet. The total population of Australopithecus anamensis may have been as much as 1000 individuals.</p>
  <h4>~5.6-1.9 mya</h4><p>
  All human fossils from this period are African.</p>
  <h4>~3.5-2 mya</h4><p>
  Some of our ancestors, including Homo Habilis, began to make stone tools. Their population may have grown as large as 10,000.</p>
  <h4>~2.3 mya</h4><p>
  Homo Habilis may have learnt to control and use fire at this time or later.</p>
  <h4>~2-1 mya</h4><p> R136a1, the heaviest star observed by current estimates, probably formed around this time. It is about 250-300 times heavier than our Sun and about 80,000 times larger by volume.</p>
  <h4>~2-1 mya</h4><p>
  Homo erectus successfully migrated out of Africa and spread out across Asia and Europe. Homo Erectus were capable runners with larger brains and greater dexterity than Homo Habilis, and their stone tools were more sophisticated. They may have had language too. Again, the species would have started as a small group of 10-20 individuals, but there may have been 500 or more individuals by the time some of them left Africa. Archaeologists have found fossils outside Africa dated to as early as 1.8 mya in Georgia, 1.7 mya in China and 1.4 mya in Spain and Indonesia. The population of Homo erectus in Europe alone may have grown to about 2000 by that time.</p>
  <h4>~1.2 mya</h4><p>
  Some of the fossils from Morocco and Ethiopia dated to this period are difficult to classify as either homo erectus or homo sapiens. The total population of humans on the planet grew to around 100,000 to 300,000 individuals.</p>
  <h4>~950 to 850 thousand years ago (kya)</h4><p>
  A group of humans, four small humans and one large adult, leave footprints that are still visible as fossils today on what is now the coast of England. This is the starting point for "The World" by Simon Sebag Montefiore (book).</p>
  <h4>~930-813 kya</h4><p>
  Global temperatures have been dropping for a long time and have suddenly dropped even further to an average of about 10 degrees. The total population of humans including homo erectus on the planet drops to around 1000 individuals.</p>
  <h4>~900-40 kya</h4><p>
  Boats were invented.</p>
  <h4>~600 kya</h4><p>
  Average temperatures drop to about 9 degrees, perhaps the lowest in 500 million years.</p>
  <h4>~500 kya</h4><p>
  The oldest fossil classified as Neanderthal is Spanish and dated to this period.</p>
  <h4>~500-83 kya</h4><p>
  Some humans started wearing clothes by this time.</p>
  <h4>~400-300 kya</h4><p>
  Spears were invented, including in Germany. Trade had developed, along with the long-distance transport of resources. The population of Homo erectus in Asia may have grown to as much as 10,000 by this time.</p>
  <h4>~300-100 kya</h4><p>
  The oldest fossil confidently identified as Homo sapiens is Moroccan and dated to this period. Some fossils suggest that within 200,000 years or so they had spread to Greece, Ethiopia, Israel, Tanzania, South Africa and China. By the end of this period, some humans have added grains to their diets, along with the other seeds, roots, fruit, leaves, insects and other meat they were already eating.</p>
  <h4>~50-40 kya</h4><p>
  The Toba supervolcano eruption occurred. Following this the total human population may have dropped to around 1000 to 20,000 individuals. It is not clear what the population was prior to this.</p>
  <h4>~50-40 kya</h4><p>
  Arrows and flutes had been invented by this time, and probably shoes too. The fossil record suggests that by this time Homo sapiens were living in Laos and Australia and not long after in the UK, Japan, Russia and Europe.</p>
  <h4>~50-1 kya</h4><p>
  Giant animals called "megafauna" that were hunted by humans begin to go extinct, including Diprotodons, Mastodons and Mammoths. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event" target="_blank">Quaternary extinction event</a>) (Films: <i>Ao: The Last Hunter</i>; <i>Alpha; 10,000 BC</i>; <i>Iceman</i>) (Game: <i>Age of Empires</i>)</p>
  <h4>~28-14 kya</h4><p>
  Humans invented rope, ceramics, fishing hooks, pottery and bread, and domesticate the dog. Some were also eating legumes by this time.</p>
  <h4>~15,000 BCE</h4><p>
  By this time, it appears humans had reached North America, presumably crossing from Siberia to Alaska before heading south, and spreading to South America by 9000 BCE. Now all major landmasses except for Antarctica were inhabited by humans. However, Fiji was not inhabited until around 3,500 years ago, and Polynesia and Aotearoa (New Zealand) until around 1000 years ago.</p>
  <h4>~12,000 BCE</h4><p>
  This point defines the beginning of the current period called the "Holocene". The human population at this time has been estimated as more than one million. By this time both large and small animals were going extinct, generally species that were hunted by humans or otherwise affected by human activity. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_extinctions_in_the_Holocene" target="_blank">Timeline of extinctions in the Holocene</a>)</p>
  <h4>~11,000 - 9000 BCE</h4><p>
  Agriculture and the domestication of sheep began in the Middle East.</p>
  <h4>~9000-8000 BCE</h4><p>
  The oldest surviving buildings are about this old, also in the Middle East. Large settlements like √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey start to form.</p>
  <h4>~9000-6000 BCE</h4><p>
  Rice agriculture began in China.</p>
  <h4>~7000 BCE</h4><p>
  Alcohol fermentation to make mead from honey has begun by this time in China, but was probably used much earlier, since it happens naturally with long-term storage of raw, unpreserved honey.</p>
  <h4>~6000-3000 BCE</h4><p>
  Sumerians, Egyptians and others invented early forms of writing, starting as proto-writing. Metalworking has also begun by this time.</p>
  <h4>~5500 BCE</h4><p>
  Sailing boats were in normal use by this time.</p>
  <h4>~4000‚Äì3500 BCE</h4><p>
  The wheel had been invented. Horses were domesticated around this time. This led to the spread of the Indo-European language family by horse-riding cultures. By around this time, the proto-Afro-Asiatic language has split into Egyptian and Semitic branches, the latter of which eventually became Hebrew, Phoenician, Aramaic and Arabic. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpXgMdvLUXw" target="_blank">Timeline of extinctions in the Holocene</a>)</p>
  <h4>~3000 BCE</h4><p>
  Cities of over 30,000 people like Uruk had formed in the Middle East. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNv3R1xS6so" target="_blank">The history of Indo-European migration with the percentage of ancestry</a>)</p>
  <h4>~3000-2200 BCE</h4><p>
  Egypt was the largest empire in history at this time. They started making paper (papyrus) by this time.</p>
  <h4>~2300 BCE</h4><p>
  The Pyramid Texts, some of the oldest literature in the world, was written.</p>
  <h4>~2300 BCE</h4><p>
  A dictionary was written in Mesopotamia.</p>
  <h4>~1800-1600 BCE</h4><p>
  According to Abrahamic religious tradition, this was the time of Abram of Israel, later called Abraham, whose descendants became slaves in Egypt by the time of Moses.</p>
  <h4>~1600 BCE</h4><p>
  The Epic of Gilgamesh was written in Babylonia.</p>
  <h4>~1550 BCE</h4><p>
  The Shang Dynasty began in China.</p>
  <h4>~1500-1000 BCE</h4><p>
  The Sanskrit Vedas, early texts of Hinduism, were written in India.</p>
  <h4>~1400-1200 BCE</h4><p>
  The Bible would later tell a story of an exodus of Israelites from captivity in Egypt that religious tradition places at this time. Archeology tells us that Egpyt was occupying Canaan at this time, so it is possible some were taken to the capital as slaves, but it is also likely that the ancestors of the Hebrews were freed by from the explusion of Egytian rule from Canaan that happened around 1200BC rather than by an exodus from the area that is now Egpyt. (Film: <i>Exodus: God's and Kings</i>)</p>
  <h4>~1300-1180 BCE</h4><p>
  Troy was destroyed (Level 6 and level 7a). This may have inspired the events of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, which inspired other works like Shakespeare's <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. According to legend, Aeneas travelled from Troy to Italy and his descendent Romulus founded Rome in 753. (Film: <i>Troy</i>) (Show: <i>Troy: Fall of a City</i>) (Play: <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>) (Book: <i>Iliad</i>)</p>
  <h4>~1122 BCE</h4><p>
  The Shang Dynasty in China overtook Egypt to become the largest empire so far in history by population.</p>
  <h4>~1200 BCE</h4><p>
  By this time Indo-European languages and culture have taken over Greece, Turkey, Eastern Europe, and the areas North of the Caspian Sea and Black Sea in Russia. The Italic language, which had split from Celtic and would become Latin, arrived in northeast Italy from the central Europe.</p>
  <h4>~1040 BCE</h4><p>
  The Zhou Dynasty began in China.</p>
  <h4>~1000-900 BCE</h4><p>
  Athens was united. A Greek alphabet was created from Semitic and Phoenician characters, adding vowels. Kind David then King Solomon reigned. The first books of the Torah, also known as the Old Testament, were written including Genesis. Israel was split by civil war into Israel and Judah. The Italic language had taken over-most of the Italian peninsula, but the Etruscans and some Greek colonies remain.</p>
  <h4>~1020 BCE</h4><p>
  United Israel was founded. Thebes in Egypt grew to a population of over 100,000 people.</p>
  <h4>~900-630 BCE</h4><p>
  Greece began to colonise the shores of the Mediterranean. Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> and other great works of Greek literature were written. In Hebrew, the Book of Job was written.</p>
  <h4>~900-500 BCE</h4><p>
  Early forms of writing developed independently in Central America.</p>
  <h4>~800-400 BCE</h4><p>
  The Book of Songs was written in China and the Upanishads were written in India. The presumably fictional "Leir of Britain", the basis for King Lear, lived around this time according to Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudohistorical <i>History of the Kings of Britain<i>.</p>
  <h4>~722-586 BCE</h4><p>
  Assyrians conquered Israel. Judea, the nation of Jerusalem and the Hebrew language, remained independent for over a century before being conquered by Babylonia. After this, Aramaic began to replace Hebrew as the primary language of Jerusalem. By this time much if not all of the Hebrew Bible (known by Jews as Tanakh and by Christians as the Old Testament) had been written.</p>
  <h4>~597-538 BCE</h4><p>
  After Judea was conquered, some Hebrews, especially wealthier Hebrews, were exiled from their homeland and moved to other parts of the Babylonian empire. Eventually, Cryus the Great allowed their return. The Hebrew Bible may have influenced Cyrus' decision to allow the return of the Jews to Judea. By around this time, monotheistic Judaism had become the religion of Jerusalem and Judea.</p>
  <h4>~551-479 BCE</h4><p>
  The life of Confucious. The Dao De Jing was also written around this time.</p>
  <h4>~546-510 BCE</h4><p>
  The Persian Achaemenid Empire conquers Lydia (now Turkey) and became the largest Empire so far in world history.</p>
  <h4>~509 BCE</h4><p>
  Rome, or members of the Roman elite, overthrew their monarchy and became a "Republic", but the wealthy Patrician class comes to have most of the power in the new constitution.</p>
  <h4>~493-490 BCE</h4><p>
  Shakespeare's play Coriolanus is based on Roman general of that name and events that supposedly happened at this time.</p>
  <h4>~490-449 BCE</h4><p>
  Persia tries to conquer Greece in the Greco-Persian wars. (Films: <i>300: Rise of Empire</i>, <i>300</i>) (Book: Herodotus, <i>Histories</i>)</p>
  <h4>~480-474 BCE</h4><p>
  The Greeks and the Carthaginians fight in the First Sicilian War. Carthage had been the only major power in Sicily until the Greeks arrived.</p>
  <h4>~472-431 BCE</h4><p>
  <i>Discourses of the Buddha</i> was written. In this period between the middle of the Greco-Persian wars and the middle of the Peloponnesian Wars between Athens and Sparta, the great plays of Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles and Aristophanes were written, widely considered the greatest pre-Shakespearean plays.</p>
  <h4>~431-404 BCE</h4><p>
  The Peloponnesian Wars between Athens and Sparta. Thucydides claims that he began writing his book on the war immediately when the war broke out. Timon of Athens, who Shakespeare wrote a play about, supposedly lived at this time. In 429 BC, the Athenian leader Pericles died. (Shakespeare's play "Pericles" is fictional and does not relate to the historical events of his life.) (Book: Thucydides, <i>History of the Peloponnesian War.</i>) (Game: Assassin's Creed: Odyssey)</p>
  <h4>~430-400BCE</h4><p>
  By this time the Indo-European languages had taken over almost all of Europe including Britain and Ireland, but large parts of Spain still spoke pre-Indo-European-languages, along with the Etruscans in Italy. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOcPDhapJ28" target="_blank">The History of the European languages 4000 BC - 2021 AD</a>)</p>
  <h4>~411 BCE</h4><p>
  The rich men of Athens, some of whom were reportedly students of Socrates, abolish democracy and establish a dictatorship called The Thirty, but it does not last long.</p>
  <h4>~405-396 BCE</h4><p>
  Rome's expansion by conquest into an Empire had begun. The Romans besieged the Etruscan city of Veii, reportedly for about 9 years, eventually conquering it around 396 BCE. At the time it was normal to enslave survivors and plunder cities after conquering them, and even greater wealth would have come from the control of the surrounding land.</p>
  <h4>~404 BCE</h4><p>
  Sparta defeated Athens.</p>
  <h4>~403-211 BCE</h4><p>
  The Warring States Period began in China.</p>
  <h4>~399 BCE</h4><p>
  The reported date of the execution of Socrates. Differing events of his trial were reported by Aristophanes and two students of Socrates: Xenophon and Plato.</p>
  <h4>~390 BCE</h4><p>
  Rome was sacked by the Gauls under their leader Brennus. This event is famously associated with the phrase "Vae victis," meaning "woe to the vanquished." This may have motivated further expansion of Rome's empire & the strengthening of Rome's defences. It was the last time Rome would be sacked until the famous Sack of Rome by the Visigoths led by Alaric almost 800 years later.</p>
  <h4>~384-322 BCE</h4><p>
  The life of Aristotle. He became a student of Plato around 367 BCE. Plato died around 347 BCE.</p>
  <h4>~359 BCE</h4><p>
  The father of Alexander the Great, Philip II, became King of Macedon and leads Macedon's expansion.</p>
  <h4>~342 BCE</h4><p>
  Alexander became a student of Aristotle.</p>
  <h4>~338 BCE</h4><p>
  King Philip II of Macedon defeats Athens. The Macedonian empire now controls all of what is now modern Greece except for Sparta, and most of what is now Bulgaria and Albania.</p>
  <h4>~336-323 BCE</h4><p>
  Alexander became king. His army defeats Persia, conquers Egypt, founds the city of Alexandria and invades Northern India, and briefly establishes the largest Empire so far in world history by population and the second largest by land area, but when Alexander dies, probably of a disease such as malaria, the Empire was quickly divided into smaller states by civil war.</p>
  <h4>~300-200 BCE</h4><p>
  The earliest Mayan writing in Central America is dated to this period.</p>
  <h4>~270 BCE</h4><p>
  After conquering most Calabria and Puglia, some of which had been controlled by the Greeks, Rome has now incorporated most of the Italian peninsula and begin to expand into Sicily, which was shared between the Greeks and the Carthaginians.</p>
  <h4>~264-241 BCE</h4><p>
  Roman Republic west to war with the city-state of Carthage in the First Punic War over the control of Sicily, previously controlled by Greece.</p>
  <h4>~250 BCE</h4><p>
  The Maurya Empire in India became the largest empire so far in history by population.</p>
  <h4>~221 BCE</h4><p>
  The Qin Dynasty unified China and began the construction of the Great Wall.</p>
  <h4>~221-202 BCE</h4><p>
  After Carthage had expanded its territory in Spain, Hannibal's father and brother law both died, and Hannibal took charge. He crossed the Italian Alps, a great mountain range, with his army and his elephants and defeated the Roman armies in several battles in Italy, but he did not conquer Rome itself. After Rome launched counter attacks, the Romans eventually defeated Hannibal in North Africa and won the war, forcing crippling terms on Carthage.</p>
  <h4>~220 BCE</h4><p>
  The Qin Dynasty in China became the largest empire so far in history by population.</p>
  <h4>~220-130 BCE</h4><p>
  Rome defeated Macedonia and took over Greece and most of Spain.</p>
  <h4>~176 BCE</h4><p>
  The Xiongnu Empire based in Mongolia became the largest empire so far in history by land area.</p>
  <h4>~149-146 BCE</h4><p>
  Although the Carthaginians were no longer a threat to Rome, the Romans started the Third Punic War. They eventually conquered Carthage, destroyed the city and committed genocide.</p>
  <h4>~63 BCE</h4><p>
  Palestine became Roman territory.</p>
  <h4>~58-50 BCE</h4><p>
  Julius Caesar led a Roman legion to conquer Gaul (now France) over a series of military campaigns known as the Gallic Wars.</p>
  <h4>~55-180 AD</h4><p>
  Prior to this time, much of the great literature read by educated Romans and Jews was written in Greek, and educated Romans and Jews themselves often wrote in Greek for this reason. Around this time Lucretius wrote his work in Latin and Virgil wrote The Aeneid, which started the tradition of great Latin literature that outlasted the Roman empire, just as the tradition of ancient Greek literature outlasted the ancient Macedonian Empire and the classical city states of Greece.</p>
  <h4>~44BCE</h4><p>
  Caesar was assassinated by his fellow Roman Senators. Caesar had grown in power through successful military campaigns, populist measures and enrichment of the army, and was largely hated and resented by the conservative Optimates. Caesar was a member of the Populares who generally sought popularity with the plebian class, while the Optimates, some of whom participated in the assassination, believed the Senate should primarily serve the wealthy aristocratic patrician class.</p>
  <h4>~42-27 BCE</h4><p>
  War broke out between the forces of the assassins and the forces of Caesar's allies. The latter forces were led by a Triumvirate including Mark Antony and Caesar's own grandnephew and adopted son, Octavian. After Antony and Octavian were successful, they split the Roman Empire between each other and later went to war with each other. Octavian's forces won and he soon became Augustus, emperor of Rome. This marked the end of the Roman "Republic" and the beginning of the Roman Empire.</p>
  <h4>~1 CE</h4><p>
  The Western Han Dynasty in China became the largest empire so far in history by population.</p>
  <h4>~47-180AD CE</h4><p>
  Paul the Apostle wrote letters in Ancient Greek promoting Christianity. Shortly afterwards, the earliest Gospels of Jesus that we have were also written in Ancient Greek, without substantial grammatical or spelling errors, as were the great works of Palestinian historians (Jewish and Christian) and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. The authors of the Coptic Gospels may have begun writing around this time.</p>
  <h4>180 CE</h4><p>
  The Pax Romana ended with the death of
  Marcus Aurelius, marking the start of Rome‚Äôs decline.</p>
  <h4>~176</h4><p>
  The Xiongnu Empire in China became the
  largest empire so far in history by land area.</p>
  <h4>235-284 CE</h4><p>
  The Crisis of the Third Century in the Roman Empire: frequent changes of emperors, political and economic instability and invasions.</p>
  <h4>250-900 CE</h4><p>
  The classic period of the Mayan civilisation in Central America. The Mayans constructed elaborate monuments and buildings including pyramids.</p>
  <h4>260 CE</h4><p>
  The Gallic Empire was formed by Postumus,
  encompassing Gaul, Britannia, and parts of Hispania, effectively
  splitting the Roman Empire temporarily.</p>
  <h4>313 CE</h4><p>
  The Edict of Milan was proclaimed by
  Constantine I, granting religious freedom and favouring
  Christianity.</p>
  <h4>330 CE</h4><p>
  Constantine I founded Constantinople,
  shifting the empire‚Äôs capital from Rome to the east.</p>
  <h4>376 CE</h4><p>
  Large groups of Goths were allowed to
  cross the Danube into Roman territory, seeking refuge from the
  Huns.</p>
  <h4>378 CE</h4><p>
  The Romans suffered a devastating defeat
  against the Goths in the Battle of Adrianople, resulting in the death
  of Emperor Valens.</p>

  The Great Depression and the Nazis.
  In 1919, Adolf Hitler joined the Nazi Party and became its leader
  the next year. In 1923, he led the Beer Hall Putsch, hoping to
  overthrow the German government. The coup failed, and a German court
  sentenced Adolf Hitler to five years in gaol. While in
  jail from 1923 to 1924, he wrote "Mein Kampf." Working class parties
  like the Social Democratic Party (SPD) were becoming increasingly
  popular. Businessmen like Fritz Thyssen and Emil Kirdorf began to
  provide financial backing to the Nazis, but in the 1928 German elections,
  the Nazi Party only won 12 seats. In 1929, the Great Depression hit,
  severely impacting the global economy. The Nazi Party's support grew.
  They won 107 seats in 1930, but this was still less than the Social
  Democratic Party. In 1931, the Nazi Party's terrorism against political
  opponents increased. Due to technological developments and ongoing financial
  support from his backers, Hitler was able to afford to fly airplanes for
  his political campaigns. In the 1932 Presidential Elections, Paul von
  Hindenburg defeated Hitler with 53% of the vote to Hitler's 37%,
  but early the next year he appointed Hitler as chancellor, effectively
  handing power over to Hitler. In the federal elections in late 1932,
  and again in early 1933, the votes on the left were split between the
  communist KPD and the social democratic SPD and the Nazis Party's
  share grew to 44% of the vote and 288 seats and the Nazis began to
  consolidate a dictatorship. After President Paul von Hindenburg's death

  subsequent declarations of war by Britain and France. In 1941, after the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, USA, the United States declared war on Japan, and Germany declared war on the United States and the Soviet Union. The coalition of powers fighting against Germany, Italy and Japan were known as the Allies. In 1945 the allies defeated Italy and the Nazi regime, and later that year the United States and their allies, having effectively won the war against Japan, dropped nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan subsequently surrendered.
