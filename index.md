About me

 
I am a lucky man.


I...


live in my home town of Adelaide, which
  
    is regarded as the most beautiful city in the world by the authors of this article and by me;
    has spacious beaches and rolling hills, both very close to the city, and fine weather;
    has some lovely restaurants, bars and pubs;
    has the cleanest air (when it comes to particulate matter) of any city of similar size or larger in the world according to PurpleAir, the most reliable website for such comparisons, where controlling variables by using many sensors of the same type in every location is more important than absolute sensor quality;
    less traffic congestion than almost all other cities.
  


love beautiful views, spending time with friends and family, tennis, music, website development, programming, pragmatic public policy ideas to make everyone's lives better, history, pre-history and Shakespeare;


teach programming at Code Camp;


am studying a graduate degree in data science;


am interested in become a full stack web developer and app developer;


like the idea of more teaching, publishing more of my music (difficult due to occasional mild tinnitus) & producing educational videos;


studied History, Languages (Italian and Latin), Literature, Logic, Maths, Physics, Linguistics, Economics and Philosophy as part of my Bachelor of Arts, and majored in European Studies;


have a graduate degree in International Security, effectively international relations with a focus on national security policy interactions;


enjoy some historical fiction, comedy shows, crime shows, thrillers and dramas, including French, Italian and Korean series;


have lived and worked in the UK, and studied in Italy and Canada, travelled in the United States, and visited China, Fiji and most Australian states.

About this website


  This website is written in a single html file with vanilla CSS and vanilla Javascript without any build tools or dependencies. It forces me to be creative and familiar with the fundamentals, and it prevents the site being too generic. I love the simplicity, power, accessibility and performance of this manual approach, at least for such a simple website, and the compromise I have found between separation of concerns, DRY, REST and locality of behaviour.

Inferno

Song One


Midway along the wild path of life,
I stumbled through the darkness of a wood,
in which the straight track had been lost from sight.





Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,
ché la diritta via era smarrita.


In-the middle of-the path of our life
me I-found for a forest dark,
of-which the straight way was lost.




How hard it is to say what that thing was,
this forest, savage and fierce that drowns with power,
that just to think of it renews my fear.




Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura
esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
che nel pensier rinova la paura!


Ay how to say what it-was is thing hard
this forest savage and harsh and strong
that in-the thought renews the fear!




It is so harsh that death is not much worse,
but to portray the good that I found there,
I will recount of other things I saw.




Tant’è amara che poco è più morte;
ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai,
dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte.


So-much it-is bitter that little is more death;
but to portray of-the good that I there found,
I-will-tell of the other things that I there have seen.




I can't explain how I had ended there,
so tired had I fallen by that point,
that I abandoned every careful way.




Io non so ben ridir com’i’ v’intrai,
tant’ero pien di sonno a quel punto
che la verace via abbandonai.


I not know well to-recount how I there entered,
so-much I-was full of sleep at that point
that the true way I-abandoned.




But when I reached the foot of that kind hill
at which that freezing valley came to rise
that pierced my heart with fear until that point,
I looked above and saw its shoulders clothed
already with the warmest rays of sun,
the light that leads us all on every path.




Ma poi ch’i’ fui al piè d’un colle giunto,
là dove terminava quella valle
che m’avea di paura il cor compunto,
guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle
vestite già de’ raggi del pianeta
che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle.


But then when I was to-the foot of a hill reached,
there where ended that valley
that to-me had of fear the heart pierced,
I-looked to high and saw the its shoulders
clothed already with-the rays of-the planet
that leads straight others through every path.




Then was the fear a little quieted,
which'd lasted like a black lake on my heart
that night which I'd just passed with so much sorrow.




Allor fu la paura un poco queta,
che nel lago del cor m’era durata
la notte ch’i’ passai con tanta pieta.

Then was the fear a little quieted,
that in-the lake of-the heart to-me had lasted
the night that I passed with so-much sorrow.




And like one soaked and gasping out of breath
whose come out of the ocean to the shore
turns and looks upon the crashing waves,
so the spirit mine that still was fleeing,
turned behind to gaze along the path
that never yet left anyone alive.




E come quei che con lena affannata,
uscito fuor del pelago a la riva,
si volge a l’acqua perigliosa e guata,
così l’animo mio, ch’ancor fuggiva,
si volse a retro a rimirar lo passo
che non lasciò già mai persona viva.

And like one who with breath labored,
having come out of-the sea to-the shore,
turns to-the water perilous and looks,
just-so the spirit mine, that still was-fleeing,
itself it-turned to behind to gaze the path
that never left yet any person alive.









  

  Democracy would be nice
  Democracy would be better than what exists
  


If you would like to comment on this article or ask any questions you can contact me here. This article was first published on the first equinox of 2024.

Most
if not all systems called democracies are hybrids between democracy and
dictatorship.

They are more
dictatorship than democracy.
Most constitutions of such countries were written undemocratically by
minority dictatorships. These constitutions are then enforced by other
minority dictatorships known as high courts and supreme courts. On top
of this, the elected politicians are generally elected by support of a
party. These parties do not often have democratic service and
representation of the democratic will as their primary objective.
Instead they tend to see our limited democracy as means to push their
own agendas, influenced by their minority ideology and further corrupted
by donations and other influences.
Most systems called democracies
have no guarantee of citizen-initiated referendum.
If more than 90% of citizens wanted to improve the constitution to
make it more democratic and reduce the power of politicians or political
parties, politicians in these countries could just choose not to hold a
referendum on that issue. If they are adequately popular to remain in
power anyway due to the limited available options and their spending
power as a party, it could take a long time for this to change.
The few constitutions that do have a guarantee of citizen-initiated
referendum have no guarantee of making this process efficient using
modern methods, and in fact require old inefficient and undemocratic
methods like gathering a minimum number of signatures.
Some
people think that many democracies exist already.
<h2
id="some-of-these-same-people-say-we-need-our-undemocratic-constitutional-dictatorships-to-protect-us-from-the-evils-of-democracy.">Some
of these same people say we need our undemocratic constitutional
dictatorships to protect us from the evils of democracy.
This is what Orwell called doublespeak. The dictatorships in our
constitutions and elsewhere in our political and economic systems are
defended by the false suggestion that they a meritocratic. But a
meritocracy needs to be designed to empower on the basis of merit to be
meritocratic. The dictatorships in the countries that call themselves
democracies are non-meritocratic and largely anti-meritocratic systems
of inherence, luck, conformity to existing power structures, social
connections, and willingness to do things for power, even when things
are unethical. A “balance of powers” between democracy and entrenched
non-meritocratic dictatorship and vested interests is far from an
adequate political system.
Currently, we only have just enough democracy to make
violent revolution unnecessary and impossible.
Thankfully, this means that we do at least have some democracy, even
though it is a very limited form of democracy within a constitutional
dictatorship. Some bloodthirsty fanatics are angry at democracy for
preventing violent revolution. But the limited democracy that we have
prevents violent revolution partly by making it unnecessary. If enough
people wanted to change the political system passionately enough, we
could do so through our meagre democratic institutions, without violent
revolution. Our system just makes it extremely inefficient to do so.
But for this reason, it may be more efficient to focus on improving 
the efficiency of the political system than to focus on any other
political issue. Currently reform is prevented through the
lies that we already have an adequate political system, that we already
have democracy, and that we have the only possible form of it, or the
only good form of it.
Our self-declared democracies are at best the
equivalent of sending a message by horseback.
Our primitive democratic dictatorships were invented around the time
that horseback messaging was the norm. They were invented when the
majority of people could not vote, not to mention be involved in the
design of the constitution.
Democracy does not by itself make a
constitution perfect, but it would be an improvement on what exists.
<h2
id="here-is-a-practical-guide-to-creating-a-system-that-is-more-democratic-and-results-in-better-policy-more-quickly-and-more-efficiently.">Here
is a practical guide to creating a system that is more democratic and
results in better policy more quickly and more efficiently.
A democracy starts with a constitution that has an efficient system
of citizen-initiated referendum, and a population who use this power to
choose democracy. A tiny number of countries have more or less satisfied
this rudimentary necessary condition for democracy, and even those have
plenty of room for further democratisation and other improvements in
their constitutions. A further improvement would be a constitution that
also requires all democratic systems to be made more efficient wherever
technological or scholarly developments allow this. A further
improvement would be a constitution that also requires adequate
education of all voters on constitutional issues, including fundamental
issues of democracy, meritocracy and efficiency that need reform
according to experts. A further improvement would be a constitution that
also requires that such experts be properly incentivised to do their job
well, in service of defending the rightful preferences of all. A further
improvement would be a constitution that also requires adequate
anti-corruption investment. A further improvement would be a
constitution that also requires adequate investment into research and
further development of democratic meritocracy. Only a combination of
most if not all of the above could be an adequate political system. No
country is even close yet.
For a more detailed policy suggestion on how to implement these
improvements, see my article “Policy One”.


  

  Policy One
  The
very boring and technical solution to all of the world’s problems
  


If you would like to comment on this article or ask any questions you can contact me here This article was first published on the first equinox of 2024.

Policy One
As quickly as feasible:

(Policy 0.1) Inform and persuade an adequate number of voters and
politicians of the need to prioritise the following policy.
(Policy 0.2) Add sensible implementation details to the following
policy.
(Policy 0.3) Implement the policy.

<h3
id="policy-one-create-department-for-improving-the-political-system">Policy
one: create department for improving the political system
Create a government department with adequate funding and oversight
to: 1) (Policy 1.1) Eliminate corruption; 2) (Policy 1.2) Improve the
political system as quickly as desired by citizens and according to
agreement between citizens and experts; 3) (Policy 1.3) Inform citizens
of the proposed changes to government policy including constitutional
reform proposals that are most strongly supported by experts; 4) (Policy
1.4) Ensure that experts are well trained and properly incentivised to
produce honest, well balanced and comprehensive reports and minimise
institutional bias.
Policy two: general policy
principles

(Policy 2.1) In non-emergency situations, do not implement a
policy until there is clear majority support.
(Policy 2.2) As part of this, when there is not yet clear
majority in support in favour of holding a referendum or making the
proposed constitutional change, do not hold a referendum yet.
(Policy 2.3) Aim to improve policy as quickly as likely to be
consistent with long-term wellbeing of citizens and democracy.
(Policy 2.4) As part of this, prioritise the improvement of
policy development mechanisms and the improvement of the constitution of
the country as quickly as likely to be consistent with long-term
wellbeing of citizens and democracy.
(Policy 2.5) As part of the above, require governments to employ
reliable experts to determine the appropriate amount of resources to
dedicate to the above, and the appropriate implementation of the above,
which will be the maximum amount of resources likely to be consistent
with long-term wellbeing of citizens and democracy.
(Policy 2.6) Once a clear majority say they will vote in favour
of this constitutional requirement, hold a referendum.
Summary:

Require government by constitution and by the enforcement of the
constitution to improve policy as quickly as likely to be consistent
with long-term wellbeing of citizens.
As part of this, require government by constitution and by the
enforcement of the constitution to improve policy development mechanisms
and the constitution of the country as quickly as likely to be
consistent with long-term wellbeing of citizens.
As part of the above, require governments to employ reliable experts
to determine the appropriate amount of resources to dedicate to the
above, which will be the maximum amount of resources likely to be
consistent with long-term wellbeing of citizens.
Implementation details
Create an independent government body whose job is to thoroughly
inform every able-minded person on expert views and public opinion on
policy matters, including constitutional matters, starting with the most
important, which is the need to for such a government body, and the need
to do the following:
Append to the constitution of the country that:

The government must allocate adequate resources to:


determine which policy proposals and reforms are most popular among
the general public and the level of support
determine which policies proposals and reforms are most supported by
policy experts and the level of support
publish all of the above data
determine which if any of these proposals and reforms contradict
existing rights and laws, and which right or law will take precedence in
case of a conflict
identify flaws in the constitution of the country according to
expert analysis and criticism from citizens
ensure that the public and the experts are informed about all of the
above through polling and information campaigns
ensure an adequate number of experts &amp; government workers are
employed to implement all of the above and that they are well trained,
well incentivised and trustworthy
prevent corruption of experts, politicians, bureaucrats, government
workers, government bodies and others
ensure that experts, politicians, bureaucrats and government bodies
are thorough and honest in their reports
successfully implement any policy, law or right that is supported by
a majority of the public at least if it also has majority support from
experts in each relevant area after all of the above has been
implemented



 




  

Timeline of the known world
according to scientists, historians and legends



If you would like to comment on this timeline or ask any questions you can contact me here.



bya = billion years ago
mya = million years ago
kya = thousand years ago
BCE (before common era) = BC (before Christ)
CE (common era) = AD (anno domini)



Scholars believe:

More than 13 billion years ago (bya)
Estimated beginning of the Big Bang. Within a second neutrons, protons (hydrogen nuclei) and electrons formed. Within a few minutes, helium nuclei formed. But it took about 400,000 years for the temperature to drop low enough for electrons to begin to orbit these nuclei and create atoms, which coincided with the creation of the first photons, the first light.
~13.6-15.3 bya      
About 200 million years later, the first stars had formed,1 probably including the Methuselah star in our own galaxy, the oldest star our scientists have measured, just 190 light-years away.
~13.4-15.1 bya
Another 200 million years or so later, the first galaxies had formed, including our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
More than 12 bya
Within one billion years of the formation of atoms, the first planets formed.
~10 bya
Andromeda probably formed around this time, the closest galaxy to our own.
~4.6 bya
The Sun formed, surrounded by a disc of solid materials, starting as dust, later coalescing to become asteroids and planets.
~4.5 bya
Around 100 million years later, the Earth and the Moon had formed, likely from a collision between two early planets. Immediately following the collision Earth was still molten lava even at the surface, over 1000 degrees, and too hot to sustain life.
~4.3-4.1 bya
The Earth cooled to an average temperature at sea level of 100 degrees Celsius, cool enough for liquid water on the surface, eventually covering the planet in one large ocean. The first self-replicating organisms appeared, possibly RNA-based proto-cells similar to virus cells.
~4.0-3.8 bya
The first self-replicating DNA-based organisms evolved, also single-celled, like bacteria.
~3.5 bya
Cyanobacteria started to create oxygen.
~2.9 bya
For the first time, the average temperature dropped to the same temperature as today and the first ice age began. Ice covered the south pole for the first time and temperatures dropped even lower.
~2.5-2.2 bya
First oxygen-using organisms evolved.
~2.4 bya
The abundance of oxygen broke down methane leading to the Huronian Glaciation, one of the coldest periods in Earth's history, and water was frozen across the whole planet.
~1.8 bya
Through the shifting of tectonic plates below the surface of the ocean, the largest continent yet begins to form.
~520 mya
After more than two billion years of evolution, the first fish evolved. They were the first vertebrates, meaning the first animals to have spines.
~470 million years ago (mya)
The first land plants evolved from algae.
~500 mya
Average temperature reaches about 30 degrees, the hottest in billions of years.
~400 mya
First plants with roots and first insects.
~375-350 mya
The first amphibians evolved, though not yet members of the clade "Amphibia".
~350-330 mya
The first reptiles evolved.
~350-170 mya
The first amniotes, dinosaurs and mammals evolved.
~310 mya
The supercontinent Pangea forms, the largest continent yet. ("History of the Earth" video)
~300 mya
Another ice age occurs. Average temperature drops briefly to about 12 degrees.
~300 mya
Average temperature spikes to 35 degrees, again the hottest in billions of years.
~150 mya
The first birds evolved.
~150 mya
The first flowers evolved.
~110 mya
The continent that is now Africa split from the continent that is now South America. They drift apart due to the splitting of the tectonic plates beneath them. The land mass that is now India and Madagascar split from the landmass of Antarctica and Australia and starts drifting towards what will become Asia.
~90 mya
The first bees evolved. Argentinosaurus also, perhaps the largest land animal ever, also existed around this time. The continent that is now Australia split from the continent that is Antarctica. The landmass of India split from Madagascar and continues North.
~90-66 mya
The first primates had evolved by this time.
~77-32 mya
UY Scuti, now the largest star observed by volume, may have formed around this time. It is about 5 billion times larger than our Sun by volume but much less dense than our Sun with about 30 times more mass.
~66 mya
The Chicxulub asteroid struck the water just off the coast of what is now Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. All dinosaurs except for birds become extinct. This is the same Peninsula that would later be the home of the Mayan civilisation.
~50 mya
Global temperatures reach a peak of 27 degrees before beginning a steady decline.
~50 mya
India collided with Asia and formed the Himalayas. Europe, North America and other continents were now quite a similar shape to their current forms.
~35-20 mya
The first apes had evolved.
~10 mya
North America and South America conjoined.
~10-5 mya
The ancestors of humans in Africa began to evolve separately from the ancestors of chimpanzees and bonobos. Initially some species may have had as few as 10-20 individuals in the species. Other species may have had as many as 500 individuals. Archaeologists have found fossils that have been dated to this period in Africa, Bulgaria and Greece. ("Seven Million Years of Human Evolution" video)(List of human evolution fossils)
~4 mya
Our ancestors the Australopithecus had evolved feet that are exclusively for walking and running and could no longer grasp branches or other objects with their feet. The total population of Australopithecus anamensis may have been as much as 1000 individuals.
~5.6-1.9 mya
All human fossils from this period are African.
~3.5-2 mya
Some of our ancestors, including Homo Habilis, began to make stone tools. Their population may have grown as large as 10,000.
~2.3 mya
Homo Habilis may have learnt to control and use fire at this time or later.
~2-1 mya R136a1, the heaviest star observed by current estimates, probably formed around this time. It is about 250-300 times heavier than our Sun and about 80,000 times larger by volume.
~2-1 mya
Homo erectus successfully migrated out of Africa and spread out across Asia and Europe. Homo Erectus were capable runners with larger brains and greater dexterity than Homo Habilis, and their stone tools were more sophisticated. They may have had language too. Again, the species would have started as a small group of 10-20 individuals, but there may have been 500 or more individuals by the time some of them left Africa. Archaeologists have found fossils outside Africa dated to as early as 1.8 mya in Georgia, 1.7 mya in China and 1.4 mya in Spain and Indonesia. The population of Homo erectus in Europe alone may have grown to about 2000 by that time.
~1.2 mya
Some of the fossils from Morocco and Ethiopia dated to this period are difficult to classify as either homo erectus or homo sapiens. The total population of humans on the planet grew to around 100,000 to 300,000 individuals.
~950 to 850 thousand years ago (kya)
A group of humans, four small humans and one large adult, leave footprints that are still visible as fossils today on what is now the coast of England. This is the starting point for "The World" by Simon Sebag Montefiore (book).
~930-813 kya
Global temperatures have been dropping for a long time and have suddenly dropped even further to an average of about 10 degrees. The total population of humans including homo erectus on the planet drops to around 1000 individuals.
~900-40 kya
Boats were invented.
~600 kya
Average temperatures drop to about 9 degrees, perhaps the lowest in 500 million years.
~500 kya
The oldest fossil classified as Neanderthal is Spanish and dated to this period.
~500-83 kya
Some humans started wearing clothes by this time.
~400-300 kya
Spears were invented, including in Germany. Trade had developed, along with the long-distance transport of resources. The population of Homo erectus in Asia may have grown to as much as 10,000 by this time.
~300-100 kya
The oldest fossil confidently identified as Homo sapiens is Moroccan and dated to this period. Some fossils suggest that within 200,000 years or so they had spread to Greece, Ethiopia, Israel, Tanzania, South Africa and China. By the end of this period, some humans have added grains to their diets, along with the other seeds, roots, fruit, leaves, insects and other meat they were already eating.
~50-40 kya
The Toba supervolcano eruption occurred. Following this the total human population may have dropped to around 1000 to 20,000 individuals. It is not clear what the population was prior to this.
~50-40 kya
Arrows and flutes had been invented by this time, and probably shoes too. The fossil record suggests that by this time Homo sapiens were living in Laos and Australia and not long after in the UK, Japan, Russia and Europe.
~50-1 kya
Giant animals called "megafauna" that were hunted by humans begin to go extinct, including Diprotodons, Mastodons and Mammoths. (Quaternary extinction event) (Films: Ao: The Last Hunter; Alpha; 10,000 BC; Iceman) (Game: Age of Empires)
~28-14 kya
Humans invented rope, ceramics, fishing hooks, pottery and bread, and domesticate the dog. Some were also eating legumes by this time.
~15,000 BCE
By this time, it appears humans had reached North America, presumably crossing from Siberia to Alaska before heading south, and spreading to South America by 9000 BCE. Now all major landmasses except for Antarctica were inhabited by humans. However, Fiji was not inhabited until around 3,500 years ago, and Polynesia and Aotearoa (New Zealand) until around 1000 years ago.
~12,000 BCE
This point defines the beginning of the current period called the "Holocene". The human population at this time has been estimated as more than one million. By this time both large and small animals were going extinct, generally species that were hunted by humans or otherwise affected by human activity. (Timeline of extinctions in the Holocene)
~11,000 - 9000 BCE
Agriculture and the domestication of sheep began in the Middle East.
~9000-8000 BCE
The oldest surviving buildings are about this old, also in the Middle East. Large settlements like Çatalhöyük in Turkey start to form.
~9000-6000 BCE
Rice agriculture began in China.
~7000 BCE
Alcohol fermentation to make mead from honey has begun by this time in China, but was probably used much earlier, since it happens naturally with long-term storage of raw, unpreserved honey.
~6000-3000 BCE
Sumerians, Egyptians and others invented early forms of writing, starting as proto-writing. Metalworking has also begun by this time.
~5500 BCE
Sailing boats were in normal use by this time.
~4000–3500 BCE
The wheel had been invented. Horses were domesticated around this time. This led to the spread of the Indo-European language family by horse-riding cultures. By around this time, the proto-Afro-Asiatic language has split into Egyptian and Semitic branches, the latter of which eventually became Hebrew, Phoenician, Aramaic and Arabic. (Timeline of extinctions in the Holocene)
~3000 BCE
Cities of over 30,000 people like Uruk had formed in the Middle East. (The history of Indo-European migration with the percentage of ancestry)
~3000-2200 BCE
Egypt was the largest empire in history at this time. They started making paper (papyrus) by this time.
~2300 BCE
The Pyramid Texts, some of the oldest literature in the world, was written.
~2300 BCE
A dictionary was written in Mesopotamia.
~1900 BCE
Hebrews began to migrate to Palestine from Babylonia.
~1800-1600 BCE
According to legend, this was the time of Abram of Israel, later called Abraham, whose descendants became slaves in Egypt by the time of Moses.
~1600 BCE
The Epic of Gilgamesh was written in Babylonia.
~1550 BCE
The Shang Dynasty began in China.
~1500-1000 BCE
The Sanskrit Vedas, early texts of Hinduism, were written in India.
~1300-1200 BCE
According to legend, there was an Exodus of Israelites from captivity in Egypt. (Film: Exodus: God's and Kings)
~1300-1180 BCE
Troy was destroyed (Level 6 and level 7a). This may have inspired the events of Homer's Iliad, which inspired other works like Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. According to legend, Aeneas travelled from Troy to Italy and his descendent Romulus founded Rome in 753. (Film: Troy) (Show: Troy: Fall of a City) (Play: Troilus and Cressida) (Book: Iliad)
~1122 BCE
The Shang Dynasty in China overtook Egypt to become the largest empire so far in history by population.
~1200 BCE
By this time Indo-European languages and culture have taken over Greece, Turkey, Eastern Europe, and the areas North of the Caspian Sea and Black Sea in Russia. The Italic language, which had split from Celtic and would become Latin, arrived in northeast Italy from the central Europe.
~1040 BCE
The Zhou Dynasty began in China.
~1000-900 BCE
Athens was united. A Greek alphabet was created from Semitic and Phoenician characters, adding vowels. Kind David then King Solomon reigned. The first books of the Torah, also known as the Old Testament, were written including Genesis. Israel was split by civil war into Israel and Judah. The Italic language had taken over-most of the Italian peninsula, but the Etruscans and some Greek colonies remain.
~1020 BCE
United Israel was founded. Thebes in Egypt grew to a population of over 100,000 people.
~900-700 BCE
Greece began to colonise the shores of the Mediterranean. Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and other great works of Greek literature were written. In Hebrew, the Book of Job was written.
~900-500 BCE
Early forms of writing developed independently in Central America.
~800-400 BCE
The Book of Songs was written in China and the Upanishads were written in India. The fictional "Leir of Britain", the basis for King Lear, supposedly lived around this time, but this was only a legend.
~722-586 BCE
Assyrians conquered Israel. Judah remained independent for over a century before being conquered by Babylonia.
~551-479 BCE
The life of Confucious. The Dao De Jing was also written around this time.
~546-510 BCE

~431-404 BCE
The Peloponnesian Wars between Athens and Sparta. Thucydides claims that he began writing his book on the war immediately when the war broke out. Timon of Athens, who Shakespeare wrote a play about, supposedly lived at this time. In 429 BC, the Athenian leader Pericles died. (Shakespeare's play "Pericles" is fictional and does not relate to the historical events of his life.) (Book: Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War.) (Game: Assassin's Creed: Odyssey)
~430-400BCE
By this time the Indo-European languages had taken over almost all of Europe including Britain and Ireland, but large parts of Spain still spoke pre-Indo-European-languages, along with the Etruscans in Italy. (The History of the European languages 4000 BC - 2021 AD)
~411 BCE
The rich men of Athens, some of whom were reportedly students of Socrates, abolish democracy and establish a dictatorship called The Thirty, but it does not last long.
~405-396 BCE
Rome's expansion by conquest into an Empire had begun. The Romans besieged the Etruscan city of Veii, reportedly for about 9 years, eventually conquering it around 396 BCE. At the time it was normal to enslave survivors and plunder cities after conquering them, and even greater wealth would have come from the control of the surrounding land.
~404 BCE
Sparta defeated Athens.
~403-211 BCE
The Warring States Period began in China.
~399 BCE
The reported date of the execution of Socrates. Differing events of his trial were reported by Aristophanes and two students of Socrates: Xenophon and Plato.
~390 BCE
Rome was sacked by the Gauls under their leader Brennus. This event is famously associated with the phrase "Vae victis," meaning "woe to the vanquished." This may have motivated further expansion of Rome's empire & the strengthening of Rome's defences. It was the last time Rome would be sacked until the famous Sack of Rome by the Visigoths led by Alaric almost 800 years later.
~384-322 BCE
The life of Aristotle. He became a student of Plato around 367 BCE. Plato died around 347 BCE.
~359 BCE
The father of Alexander the Great, Philip II, became King of Macedon and leads Macedon's expansion.
~342 BCE
Alexander became a student of Aristotle.
~338 BCE
King Philip II of Macedon defeats Athens. The Macedonian empire now controls all of what is now modern Greece except for Sparta, and most of what is now Bulgaria and Albania.
~336-323 BCE
Alexander became king. His army defeats Persia, conquers Egypt, founds the city of Alexandria and invades Northern India, and briefly establishes the largest Empire so far in world history by population and the second largest by land area, but when Alexander dies, probably of a disease such as malaria, the Empire was quickly divided into smaller states by civil war.
~300-200 BCE
The earliest Mayan writing in Central America is dated to this period.
~270 BCE

~221-202 BCE
After Carthage had expanded its territory in Spain, Hannibal's father and brother law both died, and Hannibal took charge. He crossed the Italian Alps, a great mountain range, with his army and his elephants and defeated the Roman armies in several battles in Italy, but he did not conquer Rome itself. After Rome launched counter attacks, the Romans eventually defeated Hannibal in North Africa and won the war, forcing crippling terms on Carthage.

Julius Caesar led a Roman legion to conquer Gaul (now France) over a series of military campaigns known as the Gallic Wars.
~55-180 AD
Prior to this time, much of the great literature read by educated Romans and Jews was written in Greek, and educated Romans and Jews themselves often wrote in Greek for this reason. Around this time Lucretius wrote his work in Latin and Virgil wrote The Aeneid, which started the tradition of great Latin literature that outlasted the Roman empire, just as the tradition of ancient Greek literature outlasted the ancient Macedonian Empire and the classical city states of Greece.
~44BCE
Caesar was assassinated by his fellow Roman Senators. Caesar had grown in power through successful military campaigns, populist measures and enrichment of the army, and was largely hated and resented by the conservative Optimates. Caesar was a member of the Populares who generally sought popularity with the plebian class, while the Optimates, some of whom participated in the assassination, believed the Senate should primarily serve the wealthy aristocratic patrician class.
~42-27 BCE
War broke out between the forces of the assassins and the forces of Caesar's allies. The latter forces were led by a Triumvirate including Mark Antony and Caesar's own grandnephew and adopted son, Octavian. After Antony and Octavian were successful, they split the Roman Empire between each other and later went to war with each other. Octavian's forces won and he soon became Augustus, emperor of Rome. This marked the end of the Roman "Republic" and the beginning of the Roman Empire.
~1 CE
The Western Han Dynasty in China became the largest empire so far in history by population.
~47-180AD CE
Paul the Apostle wrote letters in Ancient Greek promoting Christianity. Shortly afterwards, the earliest Gospels of Jesus that we have were also written in Ancient Greek, without substantial grammatical or spelling errors, as were the great works of Palestinian historians (Jewish and Christian) and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. The authors of the Coptic Gospels may have begun writing around this time.

followed by secular scholars and philosophers. The Quakers made
petitions to parliament. In 1772, Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief
Justice of the King's Bench, ruled that slavery was unsupported by
existing law in England, effectively leading to the release of James
Somerset, an enslaved African man.
1765-1783
Major protests against the British
began in the United States leading to the American Revolution. The
Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Second Continental
Congress on July 4th 1776, formally declaring the colonies' separation
from Britain. The British surrender at Yorktown in 1781 effectively
ended major military operations.

key powers like Germany, France, Russia, and Austria-Hungary, which
led to the collapse of several empires and the redrawing of national
boundaries.
1919-1934
The Great Depression and the Nazis.
In 1919, Adolf Hitler joined the Nazi Party and became its leader
the next year. In 1923, he led the Beer Hall Putsch, hoping to
overthrow the German government. The coup failed, and a German court
sentenced Adolf Hitler to five years in gaol. While in
jail from 1923 to 1924, he wrote "Mein Kampf." Working class parties
like the Social Democratic Party (SPD) were becoming increasingly
popular. Businessmen like Fritz Thyssen and Emil Kirdorf began to
provide financial backing to the Nazis, but in the 1928 German elections,
the Nazi Party only won 12 seats. In 1929, the Great Depression hit,
severely impacting the global economy. The Nazi Party's support grew.
They won 107 seats in 1930, but this was still less than the Social
Democratic Party. In 1931, the Nazi Party's terrorism against political
opponents increased. Due to technological developments and ongoing financial
support from his backers, Hitler was able to afford to fly airplanes for
his political campaigns. In the 1932 Presidential Elections, Paul von
Hindenburg defeated Hitler with 53% of the vote to Hitler's 37%,
but early the next year he appointed Hitler as chancellor, effectively
handing power over to Hitler. In the federal elections in late 1932,
and again in early 1933, the votes on the left were split between the
communist KPD and the social democratic SPD and the Nazis Party's
share grew to 44% of the vote and 288 seats and the Nazis began to
consolidate a dictatorship. After President Paul von Hindenburg's death
in 1934, Hitler became Germany's sole leader.
1931-1945
Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and made further expansions into Chinese and Mongolian territory in 1933 and 1936. In 1937, the second Sino-Japanese war between Japan and China officially begun. Two years later in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, leading to
subsequent declarations of war by Britain and France. In 1941, after the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, USA, the United States declared war on Japan, and Germany declared war on the United States and the Soviet Union. The coalition of powers fighting against Germany, Italy and Japan were known as the Allies. In 1945 the allies defeated Italy and the Nazi regime, and later that year the United States and their allies, having effectively won the war against Japan, dropped nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan subsequently surrendered. Subsequently national boundaries were redrawn including the creation of East and West Germany, and the United Nations was established.

  hypotheses
  Some
fun contrarian hypotheses about physics and the known universe


If you would like to comment on this article or ask any questions you can contact me here. This article was first published on the first equinox of 2024.

Most of these hypotheses have occurred to me over the last few
months, except for the last one that occurred to me years ago, and
relates to a hypothesis I came up with in high school. I am writing them
down for the first time in March 2024, to publish around the equinox on
the 20th.
It may be that all of these hypotheses are wrong, and this appears
likely since they all contradict more established hypotheses, but wrong
hypotheses of this type are beneficial, as long as no one spends
billions of dollars on a particle accelerator just to disprove them.
An understanding of what we know and do not know through physics and
the possibilities for the unknown universe is best developed by
disproving hypotheses, empirical observations and learning which we
cannot yet disprove. Simply reciting established theories and expecting
students to accept them on authority of the speaker gets in the way of
this understanding. It is much better for a student to come up with a
wrong hypothesis and have any empirical evidence against it explained to
them, if the student is capable of doing so.
So in the spirit of creativity and education, here are some
hypotheses of mine that may be wrong.
I have considered the arguments for and against my hypotheses and the
more established competing and overall I prefer my own. I will go into
more detail on the arguments that lead me to prefer my hypotheses at a
later date if requested.
But before we start, an important matter of semantics.
“The Big Bang” in my interpretations an ongoing event AND the sum of
all the matter and energy that has been a part of that ongoing event
since its beginning, albeit in a different form. In other word, every
molecule, planet, solar system, and galaxy in the observable universe is
part of an ongoing event called the big bang (event) and also part an
object that is also called the Big Bang (object). I mean that in the
sense that a galaxy is an object made from solar systems and other
matter. In the same way, the Big Bang is an object that is made from
galaxies and other matter. The Big Bang object is presumably larger than
the observable universe, since the limits of the observable universe are
determined by the impenetrable cosmic background radiation It is
extremely implausible given the projected trajectories that the Big Bang
matter has taken through its observable history that the Big Bang object
would happen to be exactly the same size as the part that we can
observe.
So far, this is all facts and semantics. I have not said anything
that is controversial under my own definitions. But here is where the
semantic disagreements become related to profound empirical
disagreements.
The object I call “The Big Bang” is often simply called the universe.
This is misleading, since it is at least conceptually plausible that the
Big Bang object and the big bang event are substantially smaller than
the whole universe. In fact, I regard it as extremely unlikely that the
largest object we can see part of, the Big Bang object, would
coincidentally happen to be the only object in the universe. This is
akin to assuming our island is the only island simply because we have
not observed other island, or out continent is the only continent simply
because we have not observed other continents yet, or our planet is the
only planet simply because we have not observed other planets yet, or
our solar system is the only solar system simply because we have not
observed other solar systems yet, or our solar system is the only solar
system with planets simply because we have not observed other solar
systems with planets yet, or that our galaxy is the only galaxy simply
because we have not observed other galaxies yet. There are arguments for
the Big Bang being the only object in the Universe and having no centre,
such that nothing can be “outside” the Big Bang object, but I do not
find these arguments as persuasive as the argument for the following set
of hypotheses:

The Big Bang object is just one object in a larger universe that
includes older objects.
The Big Bang object makes up a minority of the matter in that larger
universe.
The Milky Way is not exactly at the centre of this object, but is
close enough to the centre that the cosmic background radiation (CBR)
and the rate of expansion is roughly equal in all directions.
If we are this close to the centre, it is not necessarily by
coincidence or design. It may also because life cannot exist in
other parts of the Big Bang event. For example, the CBR may protect us
from external radiation from objects outside the Big Bang that makes the
rest of the Big Bang inhospitable. We may be at the eye of the storm
because this is the only place in the Big Bang object calm enough for
life.
The acceleration of the Big Bang, which is the acceleration of the
expansion of the Big Bang object, is due to the gravitational pull from
the mass of objects outside the Big Bang. Dark energy is simply external
gravitational pull.

The next hypothesis are relatively unrelated to the above, as they
relate to gravity and general relativity instead. There are two
hypotheses explaining the power and accuracy of Einstein’s theory of
general relativity. One is that space and time are effectively a four
dimensional curved object and this curvature causes gravity. The
alternative hypothesis is

A gravitational field causes gravity, and four dimensional
space-time is simply a mathematical model that allows us to accurately
model the gravitational field. In other words, space-time is not a
literal description of the underlying reality and space and time is not
literally curved.

Both of these hypotheses by definition fit the existing observations
equally well but there are two differences. The second hypothesis is
much more consistent with our knowledge and understanding of the world.
Yet it is the first hypothesis that is more often stated by some
physicists as if it were a fact. Overall, I regard conformity with our
knowledge and understanding of reality as better evidence than simply
being a more widely and confidently asserted hypothesis, so I favour the
latter hypothesis.
As I mentioned earlier, I have more detailed arguments for all of the
above including responses to the arguments for the competing hypotheses,
and I will share them on request.

Inferno

Canto Uno (Song One)


Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,
ché la diritta via era smarrita.


In-the middle of-the path of our life
me I-found for a forest dark,
of-which the straight way was lost.


Midway along the wild path of life,
I stumbled through the darkness of a wood,
in which the straight track had been lost from sight.



Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura
esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
che nel pensier rinova la paura!


Ay how to say what it-was is thing hard
this forest savage and harsh and strong
that in-the thought renews the fear!


How hard it is to say what that thing was,
this forest, savage and fierce that drowns with power,
that just to think of it renews my fear.


Tant’è amara che poco è più morte;
ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai,
dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte.

So-much it-is bitter that little is more death;
but to portray of-the good that I there found,
I-will-tell of the other things that I there have seen.


It is so harsh that death is not much worse,
but to portray the good that I found there,
I'll tell of other things therein I saw.


Io non so ben ridir com’i’ v’intrai,
tant’ero pien di sonno a quel punto
che la verace via abbandonai.

I not know well to-recount how I there entered,
so-much I-was full of sleep at that point
that the true way I-abandoned.


I can't explain how I had ended there,
so tired had I fallen by that point,
that I abandoned every careful way.


Ma poi ch’i’ fui al piè d’un colle giunto,
là dove terminava quella valle
che m’avea di paura il cor compunto,
guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle
vestite già de’ raggi del pianeta
che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle.


But then when I was to-the foot of a hill reached,
there where ended that valley
that to-me had of fear the heart pierced,
I-looked to high and saw the its shoulders
clothed already with-the rays of-the planet
that leads straight others through every path.


But when I reached the foot of that kind hill
at which that freezing valley came to rise
that pierced my heart with fear until that point,
I looked above and saw its shoulders clothed
already with the warmest rays of sun,
the light that leads us all on every path.


Allor fu la paura un poco queta,
che nel lago del cor m’era durata
la notte ch’i’ passai con tanta pieta.

Then was the fear a little quieted,
that in-the lake of-the heart to-me had lasted
the night that I passed with so-much sorrow.


Then was the fear a little quieted,
which'd lasted like a black lake on my heart
that night which I'd just passed with so much sorrow.


E come quei che con lena affannata,
uscito fuor del pelago a la riva,
si volge a l’acqua perigliosa e guata,
così l’animo mio, ch’ancor fuggiva,
si volse a retro a rimirar lo passo
che non lasciò già mai persona viva.

And like one who with breath labored,
having come out of-the sea to-the shore,
turns to-the water perilous and looks,
just-so the spirit mine, that still was-fleeing,
itself it-turned to behind to gaze the path
that never left yet any person alive.


And like one soaked and gasping out of breath
whose come out of the ocean to the shore
turns and looks upon the crashing waves,
so the spirit mine that still was fleeing,
turned behind to gaze along the path
that never yet left anyone alive.
